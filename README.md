A repository containing the doc and the work done during my research about UTA method.

# UTA
The UTA method is used to solve a multi-criteria problem. It build a utility function based on the preferences of the DM and it consist in solving a linear program (LP).

An improved version of the UTA is the UTASTAR. In UTA we used a single error in UTASTAR we use a double positive error function. The updated version has performed better than the regular method.
